Welcome to my sudoku solver! These are the methods I use to assist in solving the sudoku:

1. "Single Missing": Looks at each row, column, and box on the board. If any of these are entirely filled except for one number, the remaining number is filled in.
2. "One option": I look at a list of possibilities for each row, column, and box. If only one possible number is allowed in a given square, the number is filled in, and that number is removed from the list of possible numbers for its neighbors in the row, column, and box. 
3. "One spot": I look at a list of possibilities for each row, column, and box. If a number is only allowed in one place in the row/column/box, it is filled in, and removed as a possibility for the neighboring boxes in the row, column, and box. 
4. "Possibilities manip": I look at a list of possibilities for each row, column, and box. If there is a combination of two possibilities for squares in which the same two numbers are the only options, they are eliminated as possibilities from the other empty squares in the row/column/box. (The goal is to expand this function to deal with 3 numbers over 3 different squares, 4 numbers over 4 different squares, etc.)
